description: Learn how Arbiter stitches CUE-driven specs, CLI automation, and generation pipelines together.
---

Arbiter is your specification co-pilot: describe the architecture you want in CUE, press go, and let the platform provision opinions, scaffolding, governance, and monitoring in lockstep. Teams adopt it to collapse weeks of diagramming, doc writing, and boilerplate into a single reviewable spec—and to keep everything in sync as reality changes. This site is the playbook for designing that spec-first workflow, bending the CLI to your needs, and scaling the automation across products or business units.

## What you will find here

- **Overview** – why the project exists, the mental model, and how CUE fits into the workflow.
- **Guides** – deep dives on template development, code-generation architecture, GitHub sync, monitoring, and other day-2 operations.
- **Reference** – canonical CLI docs, the Arbiter CUE schema, API surfaces, and generated TypeDoc output pulled straight from the source.
- **Tutorials** – step-by-step walkthroughs (from the `basics` hands-on labs to Kubernetes-focused playbooks).
