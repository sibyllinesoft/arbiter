# Core Concepts

**Understanding Arbiter's layered architecture for specification-driven development**

Arbiter transforms complex system requirements into production-ready applications through a layered specification architecture. This guide explains the core concepts that make this transformation possible.

## The Four-Layer Architecture

Arbiter organizes system specifications into four distinct layers, each building upon the previous one:

```
Domain Models     ← What your system IS (data, business logic)
     ↓
Contracts        ← How your system COMMUNICATES (APIs, events)
     ↓
Capabilities     ← What your system DOES (services, features)
     ↓
Execution        ← Where your system RUNS (infrastructure, deployment)
```

This layered approach ensures that:
- **Changes cascade predictably** from business requirements to deployment
- **Each layer has clear responsibilities** and concerns
- **Generated code maintains consistency** across all components
- **System architecture remains coherent** as it evolves

---

## Layer 1: Domain Models

The **Domain** layer defines the core business concepts and rules that your system embodies.

### What Goes Here?

- **Entities**: Core business objects with identity (User, Order, Product)
- **Value Objects**: Immutable data structures (Address, Money, Email)
- **Domain Events**: Things that happen in your business (OrderPlaced, UserRegistered)
- **State Machines**: Business process flows (OrderProcessing, UserOnboarding)
- **Business Rules**: Invariants and constraints that must always hold

### Example Domain Specification

```cue
domain: {
  entities: {
    User: {
      id: string & =~"^usr_[a-z0-9]+$"
      email: string & =~"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
      profile: UserProfile
      createdAt: string // ISO datetime
      status: "active" | "suspended" | "pending"
    }
    
    Order: {
      id: string & =~"^ord_[a-z0-9]+$"
      userId: User.id
      items: [...OrderItem]
      total: decimal & >=0
      status: "pending" | "confirmed" | "shipped" | "delivered"
    }
  }
  
  stateMachines: {
    OrderLifecycle: {
      initial: "pending"
      states: {
        pending: { on: { confirm: "confirmed", cancel: "cancelled" } }
        confirmed: { on: { ship: "shipped", cancel: "cancelled" } }
        shipped: { on: { deliver: "delivered" } }
        delivered: {}
        cancelled: {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Why This Matters

The Domain layer serves as the **single source of truth** for your business logic. Unlike traditional approaches where business rules are scattered across database schemas, API models, and UI components, Arbiter ensures that your domain model drives everything else.

---

## Layer 2: Contracts

The **Contracts** layer defines how different parts of your system communicate with each other.

### Types of Contracts

#### HTTP APIs
RESTful or RPC-style HTTP interfaces:

```cue
contracts: {
  http: {
    UserAPI: {
      version: "v1"
      baseUrl: "/api/v1/users"
      endpoints: {
        createUser: {
          method: "POST"
          path: "/"
          request: domain.entities.User
          response: {
            user: domain.entities.User
            token: string
          }
        }
        getUser: {
          method: "GET"
          path: "/{userId}"
          parameters: { userId: domain.entities.User.id }
          response: domain.entities.User
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Event Contracts
Asynchronous communication patterns:

```cue
contracts: {
  events: {
    OrderEvents: {
      version: "v1"
      events: {
        OrderPlaced: {
          schema: {
            orderId: domain.entities.Order.id
            userId: domain.entities.User.id
            timestamp: string
            total: decimal
          }
        }
        OrderShipped: {
          schema: {
            orderId: domain.entities.Order.id
            trackingNumber: string
            carrier: string
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Contract Versioning & Compatibility

Arbiter enforces contract compatibility to prevent breaking changes:

```cue
contracts: {
  compat: {
    policy: "strict" | "loose" | "none"
    breakingChangePolicy: "semver" | "explicit-migration"
    deprecationGracePeriod: "30d" | "60d" | "90d"
  }
}
```

---

## Layer 3: Capabilities

The **Capabilities** layer defines what your services actually do and how they fulfill the contracts.

### Service Definition

```cue
services: {
  UserService: {
    // What domain entities this service owns
    owns: ["User", "UserProfile"]
    
    // What contracts this service implements
    implements: ["UserAPI"]
    
    // What events this service publishes
    publishes: ["UserCreated", "UserUpdated"]
    
    // What events this service subscribes to
    subscribes: ["OrderPlaced"] // Maybe to update user stats
    
    // Service capabilities
    capabilities: {
      httpServer: {
        port: 3000
        routes: contracts.http.UserAPI
      }
      
      eventConsumer: {
        topics: ["orders"]
      }
      
      scheduler: {
        jobs: {
          cleanupInactiveUsers: {
            schedule: "0 2 * * *" // Daily at 2 AM
            handler: "cleanupUsers"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
    // Runtime configuration
    runtime: {
      language: "typescript"
      framework: "fastify"
      database: "postgresql"
    }
  }
}
```

### Capability Types

Arbiter supports various service capability patterns:

- **HTTP Server**: REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints
- **Event Consumer**: Message queue subscribers, event handlers
- **Event Publisher**: Message producers, event emitters
- **Scheduler**: Cron jobs, recurring tasks
- **Worker**: Background job processors
- **CLI**: Command-line interfaces
- **Batch Processor**: Data processing pipelines

---

## Layer 4: Execution

The **Execution** layer specifies where and how your services run in production.

### Deployment Configuration

```cue
deployment: {
  target: "kubernetes" | "docker-compose" | "serverless" | "bare-metal"
  
  environments: {
    development: {
      replicas: 1
      resources: {
        cpu: "100m"
        memory: "256Mi"
      }
    }
    
    production: {
      replicas: 3
      resources: {
        cpu: "500m"
        memory: "1Gi"
      }
      autoscaling: {
        minReplicas: 2
        maxReplicas: 10
        targetCPU: 70
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Infrastructure Resources

```cue
infrastructure: {
  databases: {
    mainDB: {
      engine: "postgresql"
      version: "15"
      size: "small"
      backup: { retention: "7d", schedule: "0 1 * * *" }
    }
  }
  
  caches: {
    sessionCache: {
      engine: "redis"
      version: "7"
      size: "micro"
    }
  }
  
  messageQueues: {
    eventBus: {
      engine: "kafka"
      topics: ["orders", "users", "notifications"]
      partitions: 3
      retention: "168h"
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Benefits of This Architecture

### 1. **Deterministic Generation**
The same specification always produces identical code, infrastructure, and configuration files.

### 2. **Change Impact Analysis**
Modifications to any layer automatically propagate to dependent layers, making impact analysis automatic.

### 3. **Evolution Safety**
Breaking changes are detected and require explicit migrations or version bumps.

### 4. **Technology Agnostic**
The specification is independent of specific frameworks, databases, or cloud providers.

### 5. **AI-Friendly**
The structured, declarative format is ideal for AI agents to understand and modify.

## Working with Specifications

### Creating a New Specification

1. **Start with Domain**: Define your core business entities and rules
2. **Add Contracts**: Specify how systems will communicate
3. **Define Capabilities**: Declare what services will do
4. **Configure Execution**: Specify deployment and infrastructure

### Iterative Development

```bash
# Edit your specification
vim arbiter.assembly.cue

# Validate changes
arbiter check

# Preview what will be generated
arbiter generate --dry-run

# Generate the code
arbiter generate

# Test the generated system
arbiter integrate --test
```

### Version Management

Arbiter tracks specification versions and enforces compatibility:

```cue
meta: {
  version: "1.2.0"
  previous: "1.1.0"
}

codegen: {
  profile: "production-ready"
  templateHash: "abc123def456"
  compatibility: {
    checkBreakingChanges: true
    requireMigrations: true
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Domain Modeling
- **Start Simple**: Begin with core entities, add complexity gradually
- **Business-First**: Model what your business does, not how software works
- **Immutable Events**: Domain events should be immutable historical facts
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each service should own a cohesive set of domain concepts

### Contract Design
- **Version Everything**: Always include explicit versions in contracts
- **Backwards Compatible**: Design for evolution without breaking existing clients
- **Explicit Schemas**: Don't rely on implicit or inferred data structures
- **Document Intent**: Include business context in contract descriptions

### Service Architecture
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service should have a clear, focused purpose
- **Domain Alignment**: Service boundaries should match domain boundaries
- **Event-Driven**: Prefer async communication through events over direct calls
- **Stateless Logic**: Keep business logic stateless and data separate

### Deployment Strategy
- **Environment Parity**: Keep development, staging, and production similar
- **Gradual Rollout**: Design for blue-green or canary deployments
- **Observable**: Include metrics, logging, and health checks from the start
- **Recoverable**: Plan for failures and include rollback strategies
