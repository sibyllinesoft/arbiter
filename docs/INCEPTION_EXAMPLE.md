# AI-Powered Task Management System

## Overview

Build an intelligent task management application that helps users organize,
prioritize, and track their work efficiently using AI-powered recommendations
and smart scheduling.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Users can create, edit, and delete tasks
- Tasks should have priority levels (high, medium, low)
- AI recommendations for task scheduling and prioritization
- Real-time collaboration features for team projects
- Integration with calendar systems
- Mobile and web applications

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Response time must be < 200ms for core operations
- System should support 10,000+ concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- GDPR compliant data handling
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data

## Technical Constraints

- Must use TypeScript for type safety
- Backend should be RESTful API architecture
- Database must be PostgreSQL for ACID compliance
- Deploy using containerized microservices
- CI/CD pipeline required

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given a user has tasks, when they open the application, then they should see
   their task list sorted by priority
2. Given a user creates a new task, when they save it, then the AI should
   provide scheduling recommendations
3. Given a team member updates a shared task, when the update is saved, then all
   team members should see the change in real-time

## Architecture

- Type: web service
- Language: TypeScript
- Framework: Express.js with Socket.io for real-time features
- Database: PostgreSQL with Redis for caching
- Build tool: Bun for fast compilation and testing
