- Max Users: 4
- Duration: 0s
- Timestamp: Sun Aug 31 10:55:56 EDT 2025

Test Results:

Common Failure Causes:
1. Network proxy setup issues

3. Test timeout due to system overload
4. Browser compatibility issues
5. Resource exhaustion (memory/CPU)

Troubleshooting Steps:

2. Verify WebSocket server is running
3. Try running with fewer concurrent users (-u 2)
4. Increase timeout (-t 600000)
5. Run in headless mode (-h) to reduce resource usage

For debugging:
- Check test-results/report.html for detailed errors
- Run with --debug flag for more verbose output
