# CUE Dropdown Functionality Test

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The CUE dropdown in the TopBar has been successfully upgraded from a static HTML select to a fully functional, state-managed component.

### ✅ Changes Made:

1. **AppContext State Updates** (`src/contexts/AppContext.tsx`):
   - Added `selectedCueFile: string | null` to AppState
   - Added `availableCueFiles: string[]` to AppState
   - Added `SET_SELECTED_CUE_FILE` and `SET_AVAILABLE_CUE_FILES` actions
   - Added corresponding reducer cases
   - Added `setSelectedCueFile` convenience method
   - Added `useCueFileState` selector hook

2. **TopBar Component Updates** (`src/components/Layout/TopBar.tsx`):
   - Replaced static HTML select with state-managed select
   - Added `onChange` handler using `handleCueFileChange`
   - Integrated with AppContext using `useCueFileState` hook
   - Added auto-selection of first available CUE file
   - Added visual feedback with file extension indicator
   - Added disabled state when no project is selected
   - Added toast notification on CUE file change
   - Added error handling with logging

3. **Type Definitions** (`src/types/ui.ts`):
   - Updated AppState interface with CUE file properties
   - Updated AppAction union type with new actions

### ✅ Features Implemented:

- **State Management**: Full integration with existing AppContext pattern
- **Auto-Selection**: Automatically selects first CUE file if none selected
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications when switching CUE files
- **Error Handling**: Proper error catching and user notification
- **Logging**: Debug logs for troubleshooting
- **Visual Indicators**: File extension badge for selected file
- **Responsive Design**: Maintains existing styling and design system
- **TypeScript Safety**: Full type safety with strict mode compliance

### ✅ Testing Steps:

1. Open the frontend at http://localhost:3001/
2. Navigate to a project (dropdown should be enabled)
3. Click the CUE dropdown - should show all available files
4. Select a different CUE file - should see:
   - Toast notification confirming the change
   - Console log of the selection
   - File extension indicator update
   - State persisted in AppContext

### ✅ Integration Points:

- **Validation System**: CUE file changes can trigger re-validation
- **Project Context**: Dropdown disabled when no project selected
- **Toast System**: User feedback using existing toast infrastructure
- **Logging System**: Debug logs using existing logger utility
- **Design System**: Maintains consistency with existing UI patterns

### ✅ Future Enhancements:

- Dynamic CUE file discovery from project files
- API integration to fetch available CUE files from server
- Validation status per CUE file
- CUE file content preview
- Recent CUE files history

### ✅ Technical Notes:

- Uses controlled component pattern for proper React state management
- Maintains existing visual design and interactions
- Follows established AppContext patterns for consistency
- Includes proper cleanup and error boundaries
- TypeScript strict mode compliant
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

The CUE dropdown is now fully functional and ready for production use!
