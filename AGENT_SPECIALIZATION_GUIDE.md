# Agent Specialization Guide
## Clear Boundaries, Responsibilities, and Integration Patterns for the Arbiter Ecosystem

**Purpose**: This document defines the precise specialization boundaries for each agent type within the Arbiter repository, ensuring optimal expertise application while preventing overlap and conflicts.

**Ecosystem Alignment**: Specializations are designed to leverage Arbiter's performance gates, security scanning, chaos testing harness, and real-time collaborative architecture.
