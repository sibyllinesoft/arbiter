      Issues discovered during baseline test execution:
      
      1. Bun Test Issues:
         - Playwright tests being picked up by bun test causing conflicts
         - Tests timing out (>2 minutes) indicating potential infinite loops or blocking operations
         - Reporter format issues (limited to junit with --reporter-outfile)
      
      2. Vitest Issues (apps/web):
         - Missing vite dependency for configuration loading
         - ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors during config resolution
      
      3. Test File Conflicts:
         - E2E tests (*.spec.ts) causing conflicts with unit test runner
         - Mixed test environments (Playwright vs Bun/Vitest) in same discovery path
      
      4. Dependency Resolution:
         - Node modules appear incomplete or inconsistent
         - Workspace dependencies may not be properly installed
      
      Recommendations for Phase 1:
      - Separate test execution paths for different test types
      - Fix dependency resolution issues
      - Configure proper test isolation
      - Establish working test environment before proceeding with cleanup
