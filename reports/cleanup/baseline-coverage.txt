# Baseline Coverage Report - Phase 0

**Status**: Coverage Missing - Unable to Execute

**Timestamp**: 2025-01-09

## Coverage Tools Available
- `@vitest/coverage-v8` (apps/web)
- `bun test --coverage` (apps/api) 
- Potential Playwright coverage via test runner

## Execution Attempts

### API Coverage (bun test --coverage)
- **Status**: Failed to execute 
- **Issue**: Tests timeout after 2+ minutes
- **Root Cause**: Configuration or dependency issues preventing test startup

### Web Coverage (vitest)
- **Status**: Failed to execute
- **Issue**: Missing vite dependency for configuration loading
- **Error**: `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package 'vite'`

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Workspace Dependencies**: Workspace packages may not be properly installed
2. **Test Configuration**: Mixed test environments causing conflicts
3. **Build Dependencies**: Missing critical build-time dependencies

## Baseline Coverage Status
- **Line Coverage**: Unknown - coverage missing
- **Branch Coverage**: Unknown - coverage missing  
- **Function Coverage**: Unknown - coverage missing
- **Statement Coverage**: Unknown - coverage missing

## Test File Inventory (For Coverage Planning)
Found 100+ test files across the repository:
- **API Tests**: 7 test files in apps/api/
- **Web Component Tests**: 25+ component test files in apps/web/src/
- **Shared Package Tests**: 1 test file in packages/shared/
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright tests in e2e/ (causing conflicts)

## Next Steps for Coverage
1. Fix dependency installation issues
2. Separate test execution environments  
3. Configure proper test isolation
4. Re-run coverage collection once tests are working
5. Establish coverage baselines for each package/app

## Coverage Missing - Phase 1 Priority
This should be addressed as a high priority in Phase 1 cleanup as coverage data is essential for:
- Understanding test quality
- Identifying untested code paths
- Measuring cleanup progress
- Ensuring regression prevention during refactoring
