# Test Failure Analysis - Packet 3 Test Stabilization

## Summary
- Total Tests: 142 (expected based on Packet 1)
- Multiple categories of failures identified
- Primary issues: Missing dependencies, file path issues, timing problems, and assertion failures

## Failure Categories

### 1. Missing Dependencies / Import Errors
**Status: BROKEN - Requires dependency fixes**

```
- Cannot find package 'glob' from tracer.ts
- Cannot find module '@arbiter/shared' from client.ts  
- Cannot find module 'react/jsx-dev-runtime' from multiple React test files
- Cannot find module '@testing-library/react' from useWebSocket.test.tsx
- Cannot find package 'fs-extra' from multiple CLI test files
- Cannot find package 'yaml' from integrate.ts
- vi.mock is not a function (vitest not properly configured)
```

### 2. File Path and Temporary Directory Issues
**Status: FLAKY - Intermittent filesystem issues**

```
Rails & Guarantees Integration Tests:
- ENOENT errors for /tmp/rails-guarantees-test-*/package.json
- Multiple "should generate SBOM correctly" failures
- "should generate required outputs" failures
- "should demonstrate production-ready deployment" failures
```

### 3. Timing and Timeout Issues
**Status: FLAKY - Non-deterministic**

```
- "should generate alerts for SLO violations" timed out after 5000ms
- Performance tests with timing dependencies
```

### 4. Golden File / Snapshot Mismatches
**Status: BROKEN - Test drift from code changes**

```
CUE Analyzer Integration Tests:
- Golden snapshot mismatch in constraint violations test
- Expected path "../../../../../../..test-file.cue:3:9" 
- Received path "../../../../..test-file.cue:3:9"
- Additional fields: graph: undefined, value: undefined
```

### 5. Security and Validation Logic Issues  
**Status: BROKEN - Logic errors in tests**

```
Security & Ticket Hardening Tests:
- Patch canonicalization failures (line ending normalization)
- BOM removal not working correctly  
- Ticket expiration not working (10ms timeout too short?)
- Non-canonical patch validation not working
```

### 6. Performance Calculation Issues
**Status: BROKEN - Mathematical errors**

```
Performance Monitor Tests:
- Percentile calculation wrong: expected p95=95, got p95=100
- Statistical calculation errors in performance metrics
```

### 7. Schema Validation Issues
**Status: BROKEN - Zod schema configuration**

```
Contract Validation Tests:
- Schema not rejecting extra fields as expected
- createProjectSchema allowing invalid data
```

### 8. Health Status and Monitoring Issues
**Status: BROKEN - State management**

```
Rails Integration Tests:
- Expected health status "healthy", got "unhealthy"
- Performance budget violation handling
- Expected result length 1, got length 2
```

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Stabilization (This Packet)
1. **Quarantine Flaky Tests** - Move timing-dependent and temp-file-dependent tests
2. **Fix Import Dependencies** - Update missing package references  
3. **Update Golden Files** - Regenerate snapshots to match current output
4. **Fix Simple Logic Errors** - Correct obvious test bugs

### Future Packets
1. **Dependency Resolution** - Full package.json and import cleanup
2. **Test Environment** - Proper vitest configuration and React testing setup
3. **Performance Test Redesign** - More robust timing and calculation tests
4. **Integration Test Refactor** - Remove filesystem dependencies in temp tests
