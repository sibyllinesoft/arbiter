# Refactoring Pull Request

## Refactoring Overview
Description of the refactoring work and its objectives.

## Type of Refactoring
- [ ] Code structure improvement
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Technical debt reduction
- [ ] Design pattern implementation
- [ ] Dependency cleanup
- [ ] Type safety improvement
- [ ] Error handling enhancement

## Impact Analysis
### Files Modified
List of key files and nature of changes.

### Scope of Changes
- [ ] Single module/package
- [ ] Multiple related modules
- [ ] Cross-package changes
- [ ] Breaking API changes

## Safety Measures
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage exists before refactoring
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] New tests added where coverage was lacking
- [ ] Behavior preserved (no functional changes)
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved

## Quality Improvements
### Code Quality Metrics
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity reduced
- [ ] Code duplication eliminated
- [ ] Type safety improved
- [ ] Documentation coverage increased

### Technical Debt Reduction
- [ ] Dead code removed
- [ ] Deprecated patterns updated
- [ ] Dependencies optimized
- [ ] Configuration simplified

## Verification Steps
- [ ] All tests pass (`bun run test`)
- [ ] Type checking passes (`bun run typecheck`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`bun run lint`)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`bun run build:all`)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained
- [ ] Memory usage not increased significantly

## Rollback Plan
- [ ] Changes can be safely reverted
- [ ] Dependencies are backward compatible
- [ ] Configuration changes are optional
- [ ] Feature flags used for risky changes (if applicable)

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Code comments updated
- [ ] API documentation revised
- [ ] Architecture documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Migration guide provided (if needed)

## Review Guidelines
### Key Areas to Review
- Correctness of the refactored logic
- Performance implications
- Type safety improvements
- Code readability and maintainability

### Testing Strategy
- Focus on regression testing
- Performance testing for optimizations
- Edge case verification
- Integration testing for cross-module changes

## Deployment Considerations
- [ ] No runtime behavior changes
- [ ] Configuration migration not required
- [ ] Database changes not required
- [ ] Service restart sufficient for deployment

## Follow-up Tasks
List any additional refactoring or cleanup that should be done in subsequent PRs.
